# Card-Shuffle

## Description 
This program is a card shuffling simulation to show the amount of time/iterations it takes to achieve the same card shuffle twice given n cards.

## Program details
The program will prompt the user to select how many cards they would like to shuffle (1 to 52 cards).
The program will then shuffle the cards and add the shuffle to a dictionary.
The program will continue to shuffle the cards until it matches the shuffle in the dictionary,
or until the system runs out of memory.

If the program does find a duplicate shuffle, the program will end with stats on how many itterations and how much time it took.
